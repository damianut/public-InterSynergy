INTERSYNERGY

This project is solution for tasks 1, 2 and 3 from 
https://git.atebox.com/questanddie/is-backend-php-recruitment-1/tree/bbc24886d060921d900e702e27678687375aeb22

InterSynergy is a name of software company, which employee created this tasks.
In this project I use name 'CV Center' to describe whole system, which allows
to maintaining candidates's accounts.

To run this CV Center system, code from this repo and from 'damianut/wordpress'
repo is needed.

.1. Requirements:
  .a. Symfony
  .b. Composer
  .c. MySQL server
  .d. HTTP server

.2. Installation:
  .a. Clone damianut/InterSynergy repo.
      This repo will be called 'main repo' later in this README.
  .b. Download and install vendors in main repo.
      $ cd <cloned-main-repo-dir>
      $ composer install
  .c. Clone following repo: https://github.com/damianut/wordpress to
      root directory of your HTTP server. 
      This repo will be called 'wordpress repo' later in this README.
  .d. Run MySQL server and HTTP server if they aren't running.
  .e. Create empty `intersynergy` database in MySQL. Then create user
      ('wordpress'@'localhost' for example) with password and grant him all
      privileges on `intersynergy`.*
  .f. Import 'intersynergy.sql' file from cloned repo to your MySQL server
      by e.g. phpMyAdmin. It's may takes a while.
  .g. Execute following statement in `intersynergy` database,
      to create admin account:
  
      INSERT INTO `user` (`id`, `email`, `roles`, `password`, `enabled`,
      `failed_login`, `name`, `surname`, `pesel`, `nip`, `address`,
      `person_description`, `interests`, `skills`, `experience`, `birth_date`,
      `rating`, `cvfilename`, `registration_date`, `entry_updating_date`,
      `login_date`, `blocked_confirmation_token`, `reset_token`, `logged_token`)
      VALUES (NULL, 'admin@example.com', '[\"ROLE_USER\", \"ROLE_ADMIN\"]',
      '$argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=4,p=1$4GLWgxZ17qo6BIVk9JGt3Q$2svq7eZql+td/XGboaOljR6kXUum5o1XQx2H/qxW0X0',
      1, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL,
      NULL, NULL, NULL, '2020-02-26 14:44:35', '2020-02-26 14:44:35',
      '2020-02-26 14:44:35', NULL, NULL, NULL);
      
  .h. Configure MySQL server version in `config/packages/doctrine.yaml`.
  .i. Change DATABASE_URL variable in `.env` file according to your data
      (mysql username and password, localhost and port).
  .j. If your data provided in above variable contains reserved character(s)
      defined in RFC 3986 see following site: 
      https://symfony.com/doc/current/doctrine.html#configuring-the-database
  .k. Edit 'wp-config.php' file in wordpress repo. Change line 26 and 29 with
      name and password of your mysql account granted with all privileges to
      `intersynergy` database.
  .l. Configure Swiftmailer. I used Gmail for testing purpose.
    .l.1. Allow for less secure apps in Your Gmail account.
    .l.2. Change email and password in MAILER_URL variable in `.env` file.
          Encode reserved characters defined in RFC 3986.
    .l.3. Change email in `app.mail_sender` parameter in `/config/services.yaml`

.3. Running and testing:
  .a. Run Symfony Local Web Server
      $ cd <cloned-repo-dir>
      $ sudo symfony serve // Server default listening 8000 port
  .b. Go to `http://localhost:<your-port>/main-page`, where '<your-port> is
      the port that is listening by Symfony server. If you see page with title
      'CV Center' it's mean that server works (I assume, that MySQL server is
      running).
      If you ran server to listening on another port; edit line 43
      `wp-content/themes/twentynineteen-child/functions.php` in wordpress repo
      and change '8000' with number of your port.
  .c. Check that login to accounts works. Actually one account is created in
      CV Center - admin account. Login to account with following email and
      password:
      email: admin@example.com
      password: intersynergy
  .d. Create new account in page 'http://localhost:8000/main-page'.Then go to 
      'http://localhost/wordpress' to check, that instance of WordPress
      works. Click on title 'Anonymous Candidate1' to check specific data of
      created user.
      
.4. Instructions for Admin.
  .4.2. Editing Users
  Editing ID's of Users is removed to prevent duplicate IDs.
